## downloadCleaner

This project takes the information and files that are in the Downloads folder and sorts them to the appropriate folder based on file type. The code is relatively simple, splitting the file names down into their parts, but the movement is made possible by shutil.

## emailBot

This is a template on how to make an email bot. It uses the smtplib library. In order to get this to properly function on a machine, would need to make some updates and change settings within gmail.

## financeManager

This project works by bringing in a CSV that contains transactions and calculating the month's transactions. It's helpful in that it would create a new file for each month, but not necessarily something I'll be implementing.
